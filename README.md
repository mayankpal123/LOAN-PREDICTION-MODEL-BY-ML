📌 Project Overview

This project applies machine learning and data visualization to predict and analyze loan approval decisions. Using a dataset with applicant demographics, income, employment, loan details, and asset values, the goal is to uncover patterns and simulate scenarios that affect loan approvals.

🚀 Key Features

Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared dataset for modeling.

Model Training: Built a Random Forest Classifier to predict loan approval status.

Scenario Analysis:

Effect of 20% increase in annual income.

Impact of all applicants being self-employed.

Visualizations: Count plots, pie charts, histograms, and box plots to explore trends in education, employment, assets, and loan status.

📊 Insights

Higher income slightly improves approval probability.

Employment type (self-employed vs. non-self-employed) shows differences in approval likelihood.

Assets and education influence loan approval trends.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn)

Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization

Machine Learning: Random Forest Classifier
